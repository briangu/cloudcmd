add ability to only index certain file types (white list) - e.g. index *.jpg
[bug] cant index single files or glob file list

make blacklist matching regex
stats - e.g. or sort results by properties, such as size
replication policy - min copies
pack
gc
crack zip files and get content list
compression of subblocks
subblock to file-meta reverse map
  needed for verify error chaining
  needed for gc and removal of files (effectively ref counting)
purge cache
rebalance - apply replication policy and purge unnecessary blocks, while also balancing disk space on file adapter
verify (partially done) -- need to trace back to the holding meta files and ensure the files are still readable

skip cache and push directly to at least one adapter
allow for .cld optional blacklists (e.g. in user-custom properties)

[x] repair - do verify and then push
[x] remove file - have to account for references to a subblock
